## Tech Stack Used
1. React: The entire front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. React Context: React Context is used for state management, allowing data to be shared between components without having to pass props manually through the component tree.

3. CSS Modules: Modular CSS stylesheets are used to style the components. CSS Modules help in encapsulating styles and prevent global CSS conflicts.

4. HTML and JavaScript: HTML is used for structuring the web page, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and functionality to the app.

5. localStorage: The localStorage Web API is used to store and retrieve the to-do list data locally in the user's browser.

6. React Icons: Icons from the react-icons library are used for social media icons (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and other icons (e.g., save, cancel, edit, delete).
